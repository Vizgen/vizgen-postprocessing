# Vizgen Post-processing Tool

The Vizgen Post-processing Tool (VPT) enables users to reprocess and refine the single-cell results of MERSCOPE experiments. 
VPT is a command line tool that emphasizes scalable, reproducible analysis, and can be run on a workstation, a cluster, or 
be deployed in a cloud computing environment.


## Features
- Perform cell segmentation
    - Reproduce standard Vizgen segmentation options
    - Perform reproducible custom segmentation
- Import cell segmentation from other tools
    - Supports geojson and hdf5 formats
- Regenerate single cell data with new segmentation
    - Cell by gene matrix
    - Cell spatial metadata
    - Image intensity in each cell
    - Update MERSCOPE Vizualizer file (vzg)
- Image format conversion
    - Convert large tiff files to single or multi-channel Pyramidal OME-TIFF files
- Nextflow compatible, example pipeline provided


## Installation

Install the tool through your choice of 
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/quickstart/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

To access in-utility help documentation run the process below in the installed environment.
```bash
  vpt --help
```
    
## Usage

VPT accepts two types of inputs to specify how to run segmentation:
- Command line parameters
    - relate to where to find the input data and are expected to vary with each experiment
- Segmentation algorithm .json file parameters
    - describes a series of steps to perform on the input data

Using the same segmentation algorithm on a series of experiments ensures that they are processed identically and reproducibly.

In addition to the user guide, several working segmentation algorithm .json files are provided that can serve either as a 
robust segmentation definition or as a template for a custom workflow.

## Quick start commands:


run-segmentation    ​
- Top-level interface for vpt which invokes the segmentation functionality of the tool.​

prepare-segmentation​
 - Generates a segmentation specification json file to be used for cell segmentation tasks. ​

run-segmentation-on-tile​
 - Executes the segmentation algorithm on a specific tile of the mosaic images.​

compile-tile-segmentation​
- Combines the per-tile segmentation outputs into a single, internally-consistent parquet file containing all of the 
segmentation boundaries found in the experiment.​

derive-entity-metadata​
- Uses the segmentation boundaries to calculate the geometric attributes of each Entity​

partition-transcripts​
- Uses the segmentation boundaries to determine which Entity, if any, contains each detected transcript.​

sum-signals​
- Uses the segmentation boundaries to find the intensity of each mosaic image in each Entity.​

update-vzg​
- Updates an existing .vzg file with new segmentation boundaries and the corresponding expression matrix.​

convert-geometry​
- Converts Entity boundaries produced by a different tool into a vpt compatible parquet file.​

convert-to-ome​
- Transforms the large 16-bit mosaic tiff images produced by the MERSCOPE into a OME pyramidal tiff.​

convert-to-rgb-ome​
- Converts up to three flat tiff images into rgb OME-tiff pyramidal images.​
