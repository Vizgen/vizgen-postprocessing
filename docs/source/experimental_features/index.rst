Experimental Features
===========================================================


.. note::
    Vizgen would like to note that the experimental features of ``vpt`` are a work in progress and are not yet fully vetted. 
    The functionality under development may be useful, but may also be unstable and subject to change. Vizgen is actively 
    refining and improving these features and your feedback is invaluable in this process. Please exercise caution when using 
    these features in critical tasks or production environments.

    To access these experiemental features, set environment variable ``VPT_EXPERIMENTAL`` to “true” or “1” and the 
    functionality will be available.
